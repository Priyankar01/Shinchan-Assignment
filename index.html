            Shinnosuke is based on the character Shinnosuke Nikaido of another
            series by Yoshito Usui, Darakuya Store Monogatari. He is a naughty
            child around which the series is made. He balks at washing dishes
            and taking out the dog. What is most interesting, though not as
            far-out as the other differences, is that he rarely screams, rarely
            cries or throws tantrums, and is often punished. His works are
            always done by his puppy dog eyes. He generally pulls his pants down
            when happy and dances while singing "Buri! Buri!" (ケツだけ星人). He
            also likes to do the elephant dance (ゾーさん / zō-san) which
            consists of that an elephant is drawn around the penis, which acts
            like a trumpet. He always runs to the nearest TV at 5 PM to see
            Action Mask and, when he can't go inside his house he will go at
            Masao's house. He is a member of the Kasukabe Defence Force. He has
            his own imaginary character called Buriburizaemon.
